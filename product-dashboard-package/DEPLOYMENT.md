# Deployment Guide for Product Management Dashboard

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Product Management Dashboard application to a production environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm/pnpm
- Git
- A server or hosting platform for the frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- A server for the backend API (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. Here are the steps to deploy it:

1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   cd product-dashboard
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   ```

2. The build output will be in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service.

3. For services like Vercel or Netlify, you can connect your repository and they will automatically build and deploy your application.

4. Make sure to set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to point to your backend API URL in your production environment.

## Backend Deployment

The backend is an Express.js application. Here are the steps to deploy it:

1. Prepare the backend for deployment:
   ```bash
   cd product-dashboard/server
   pnpm install
   ```

2. For services like Heroku, you can deploy directly from your repository.

3. Make sure to set the following environment variables in your production environment:
   - `PORT`: The port your server will run on (often set automatically by the hosting provider)
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

4. For database integration, you would need to:
   - Set up a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Update the connection string in your server configuration
   - Implement proper data persistence instead of the in-memory storage

## CORS Configuration

Ensure that CORS is properly configured on your backend to accept requests from your frontend domain:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```

## Security Considerations

Before deploying to production, consider implementing:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. HTTPS for secure communication
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Proper error handling and logging

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment, set up:

1. Application monitoring
2. Error tracking
3. Regular backups
4. Update dependencies regularly to address security vulnerabilities

## Scaling Considerations

As your application grows, consider:

1. Implementing a CDN for static assets
2. Database optimization
3. Load balancing for the backend
4. Caching strategies
